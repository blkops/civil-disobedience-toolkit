# civil-disobedience-toolkit

#Purpose
The purpose of the civil disobedience toolkit is to gather a collection of open source tools that enable free speech and civil disobedience. Currently therer are several technological tools used to enable mass surveillance of peaceful protests as
well as stifle dissent. Tools such as stingrays to capture cell phone data,  unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), surveillance
over social media by creating fake social media accounts to monitor political activities of activists on social media. 

#Focus Areas
1. Enabling secure communications - Allowing activists to use secure encrypted means of communication to prevent mass surveillanve
2. Identifying countermeasures of mass surveillance - Identifying the tools and techniques of mass surveillance used to stifle dissent and 
identifying effective tech countermeasures. 
3. Enabling organization and connectivity -Identify or create tools for activists to organize and broadcast their messages effectively and coordinate better
4. Increasing resilience - Identifying tools and techniques that increase the likelihood that civil action will be successful and
less prone to disruption due to targeting of key activists within an organization. 

The goal is not to necessarily write an overarching platform from scratch. Where possible we should leverage existing technology
and only create new tools where no existing tool exists.
